\emph{
  First, I would like to thank my academic supervisor, professor Alessandro Marchetto, for the guidance and the support.\\
  I extend my gratitude to Corvina \& Exor International companies for giving me the opportunity to work on this challenging and actual project, in particular to my co-supervisors Marcello and Arrigo for their mentorship, technical assistance and continous feedback during the internship. The hands-on experience and exposure to real-world industrial challenges have been invaluable for both my personal and professional growth.\\
  As always, thanks to my family for their unconditional support, source of strength and motivation.\\
  Last but not least, I would like to say thank you to my friends and all the individuals who have been part of this journey.
