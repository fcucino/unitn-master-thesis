The rapid and widespread adoption of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies has revolutioned industries such as manufacturing, energy and transportation by enabling real time monitoring and automation. However, this increased connectivity has expanded the attack surface for cyberattacks, exposing industrial devices and operation technologies networks to new threats. In addition, such legacy and constrained systems often lack modern security features and, due to their critical nature, they are often difficult to update or replace.

This thesis presents an approach to address these challenges by presenting the design and the implementation of a security scanning tool specifically for industrial devices. The tool aims to identify misconfigurations while providing actionable recommendations to enhance the security posture, ensuring the integrity, confidentiality and availability of industrial systems. The research incorporates a comprehensive scanning methodology aligned with the most recent industry standards and regulations requirements.

The scanning tool evaluates key risk factors, including outdated software, weak credentials and insecure configurations and it outputs a detailed report that guide users in mitigating the identified weaknesses. It has been designed to be modular and extensible and it has been tested on a series of real industrial devices.
