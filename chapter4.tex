\section{Companies}

The company where we did our internship is located in the province of Verona in Italy. It's owned by a holding group which controls some other companies and startups, all located in the same place. It includes the main company, that is the one that design and produces the industrial devices, and another company. 

The latter is the business where we are legally enrolled in for the internship; it is in charge of the development of a management software that allows these devices to become domotic, that is industrial automation, in order to send and receive data from the cloud, to be able to interact with the device remotely, and to be able to monitor the status of the device. The software is a built-in service running on the hardware, and all the data are collected and sent to the cloud through the company's servers.

Since the businesses are under the same holding group, they share administrative resources and also technical resources. From now on, we refer to the main company talking about standards, regulations and devices, and to the second one talking about the software and the cloud.

\subsection{Cloud software company}

The cloud management software is composed of five main layers, managed by five different teams:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Device}: it should make easy the adoption of the platform, and it handles all the cloud lifecycle of a device, by managing the device registration and configuration of the service on the hardware and the server-side handling of the collected data to being able to create flexible dashboards and reports;
  \item \textbf{VPN}: it handles the connection to a device through a VPN, and it is in charge of the security of the connection.;
  \item \textbf{Apps}: the work of apps team is to increase the value of the platform, by allowing third-parties to integrate their services with the platform, and by creating apps that can be installed on the devices. Customers can craft their own apps by using the provided \textit{Software Development Kit} (SDK), that is a set of tools and documentation;
  \item \textbf{Core}: it is the core of the platform, and it in responsible for the provided backend REST APIs mainly used for the frontend web site. It also handles the management of the user via a custom \textit{IDentity Provider} (IDP);
  \item \textbf{Platform}: last but not least, the platform team orchestrate all the infrastructure needed to run the services, and it is in charge of the deployment of the services on the cloud. It is also responsible for the monitoring of the services, and for the security of the development lifecycle and deploy process.
\end{itemize}

The cloud software is developed using the microservices architecture, that is a design pattern that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

We were virtually part of the apps team, and we were in charge of developing a scanning tool that can be used to check the security of the devices, and to report the issues to the user.

\section{Initial design}

Under the hood, every PLC is powered by a custom Linux distribution, provided by \textit{Yocto Project}, an open source collaboration project that helps developers create custom Linux-based systems regardless of the hardware architecture~\cite{yocto-project}, that is developed by the internal \textit{Research \& Development} (R\&D) team.

In order to be able to make the device interacting with the industrial machines, the company provides a proprietary IDE software, needed to scratch projects and deploy them on the device. This software let the user define the inputs and outputs of the device, and the logic that will be executed on the device. In example, the user can define a trigger, an alarm that will be raised when a certain condition is met, a personalized handling of the data received by the many supported protocols, and so on.

Furthermore, the same IDE is used to draw the graphical interface that will be displayed on the HMI, and to define the behavior of the interface itself.\\
The graphical interface is composed by widgets, that are the building blocks of the interface. The user can define the position of the widgets, their size, their color, and their behavior. The widgets can be buttons, labels, images, graphs or custom-defined ones.

The setup with their IDE software is strictly related to the device interacting with the industrial machines, and it is not the focus of the internship project. The focus is on the device itself, and on the software that runs on it.

Given that, at the beginning, our scanning tool cannot be installed and released as a firmware update for the devices, because that would require a modification of the R\&D team's workflow, we decided to develop the scanning tool as an executable binary that can be run on the device itself. It is a \textit{command-line interface} (CLI) tool able to perform the scan and to report an output to the user. Than, the user will be able to fix the issues by itself, by interacting with the device settings.

\section{Device settings}

The PLC backend provides a web interface that can be used to view and change the system settings of the device. The user can change the network settings, set the datetime, set the management user password, manage the startup of the services like the SSH server, and much more. The HMI touchscreen, through dedicated gestures, let the user directly interact locally with the on-board interface, otherwise it is possible to reach it by connecting to the device's network address. \\
Client and server, respectively the graphical interface and the backend, are indipendent of each other; the web interface is powered by REST APIs, which are endpoints that can be called in a RESTful way, meaning that the user transfers a representation of the state of the resource to the requester or endpoint with appropriate HTTP methods to perform standard database functions like creating, reading, updating and deleting records (also known as \textit{CRUD}) within a resource.~\cite{rest-api}

For the internship project we will take advantage of the REST APIs to retrieve the status of the device, and to potentially change its settings. Internally to the company, the APIs are documented with the \textit{OpenAPI Specification}, formerly \textit{Swagger Specification}, that is an API description format that depicts the endpoints, the parameters, the responses, the authentication needed to call them and licenses or other informations. The Swagger file can be visualized through the Swagger UI, a web interface that renders OpenAPI definitions as interactive documentation.~\cite{openapi-swagger}

We can devise two different scenarios: API calls made by a remote host over a network and API calls made by the local host. In the first case, the TLS protocol secures the communication using the public-key authentication first, and then the APIs are protected by a basic authentication, that is the client must provide a management username and its related password. In the second case, the webserver listens over a port only accessible by the same host with no further authentication needed.

\section{\textit{Go} programming language}

\textit{Go} is an open-source programming language supported by Google, designed for building simple, reliable, and efficient software. It is statically typed, compiled, and syntactically similar to C, with the added benefits of built-in concurrency management, garbage collection, memory safety, and a robust standard library plus packages. Go is widely used in cloud computing, web development, and systems programming due to its simplicity, performance, and scalability.~\cite{go-lang-site}~\cite{go-lang-wikipedia}\\
Go has been released in 2007 by Google, and at the time of writing it is at version \texttt{1.22}.

One of the main reasons for choosing Go for the internship project is its versatility in building executable binaries for multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Go's cross-compilation capabilities allow the developers to build binaries for different operating systems and architectures from a single codebase, simplifying the deployment process and ensuring compatibility across various platforms. Given that the industrial devices run on different architectures and operating systems, the ability to build cross-platform binaries is essential. The language natively supports the binaries compilation for over 50 combinations of operating systems and architectures~\cite{go-lang-compilation-combo}; given that the majority of the company's devices run either on \texttt{Arm 32bit} or \texttt{Arm 64bit} or \texttt{x86 64bit} architectures, the Go compiler can generate the executables for these architectures with no further configuration needed.

Go's standard library provides comprehensive support for networking, encryption, and concurrency. The built-in packages for HTTP, TLS, and JSON processing simplify the implementation of RESTful APIs, secure communication channels, and data serialization/deserialization, respectively. If additional functionalities are required, the language supports third-party packages through the Go module system; in order to download a custom package, the developer simply reference it in the code via the link to the repository, and the Go compiler will automatically download and install it.

Go also offers a robust testing framework to write unit tests and benchmarks to ensure the reliability and performance of their code. The testing framework is integrated into the language and provides a simple and efficient way to write tests for functions and methods. The testing framework also supports the generation of code coverage reports to identify untested code paths and improve the overall test coverage. Furthermore, Go's testing framework supports the use of table-driven tests, which allow the developer to define test cases in a structured format and iterate over them to execute the tests and also it supports fuzzing, a technique used to discover vulnerabilities in software by providing random or invalid inputs to the program.

Another point in favor is the efficiency of the language. Go is compiled to machine code, which makes it faster than interpreted languages like Python. The language's garbage collection mechanism automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation, reducing the risk of memory leaks and improving the overall performance of the application. The language is more than a full order of magnitude faster than Python, with a smaller memory footprint and faster execution times.~\cite{go-lang-performance}

\section{How IEC 62443 driven the design}

Recalling~\cref{sec:iec-62443}, the IEC 62443 standard provides a comprehensive framework for securing industrial control systems and operational technology networks. In order to perform a step towards the certification of the devices with the standard, the scanning tool must cover at least the aspects of the standard.

We did a case-study on the standard documentation: for each of the security requirements listed in the \texttt{3-3}, \texttt{4-1} and \texttt{4-2} documents, we said: 
\begin{mdframed}
  \textit{\textless\textless  Can we implement a check for this requirement in such a way to make the user able to fix the potential issue by itself? \textgreater\textgreater}
\end{mdframed}
We considered the user as a person that has a management account on the device, and that has to interact using the settings web interface. The goal was to make the final user able to fix the reported issue without the need of updating the firmware or asking for a modification on the source-code or on the development lifecycle.

\cref{fig:iec62443-findings-3_3} and~\cref{fig:iec62443-findings-4_2} show the findings of the case-study. The table is divided into four columns: the first one is the security requirement title, the second one is the description text, the third is whether we believe that it is a check we should implement on a scanning tool and the fourth one contains some notes about the possible implementation.

\begin{figure}[t]

\end{figure}

  \caption{IEC 62443 \texttt{4-2} chosen requirements}
  \label{fig:iec62443-findings-4_2}
\end{figure}

To better explain our choices and motivations, we now take into account the \textit{SR 1.9 - Strength of public key authentication} requirement. The requirement states that there must be the capability to validate the validity of the used certificates by checking the signature, the expiration date, and the revocation status. We believe that this is a check that we should implement in the scanning tool, because the user can fix the issue by itself by renewing the certificate, or by changing the certificate authority if needed. The implementation of the check could be done by retrieving the certificate from the device, and then checking the signature, the expiration date, and the revocation status. If the certificate is self-signed, the tool could suggest the user to change it with a certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority.

Instead, we now consider the \textit{SR 1.7 - Strength of password-based authentication}. The requirement states that the password must have a minimum length and variety of characters types. We put this assertion in a limbo, because if the user can set a password not respecting the requirement, the tool, which is an intermediate between the user and the backend, cannot enforce the requirement. Than, the issue should be solved by the R\&D team, that should implement a password policy on the backend, and the user should be forced to change the password at the next login.

With this approach, we have identified the checks that the scanning tool should cover for sure from the standard, and we have included them in the backlog of the project.

\section{Agile method}

The \textit{Agile methodology} is a project management philosophy that involves breaking the project into phases and emphasizes continuous collaboration and improvement. Teams follow a cycle of planning, executing, and evaluating. Teams choose agile so they can respond to changes in the marketplace or feedback from customers quickly without derailing a year's worth of plans. The publication of the Agile Manifesto\footnote{\url{https://agilemanifesto.org/}} in 2001 marks the birth of agile as a methodology. Since then, many agile frameworks have emerged such as scrum, kanban, lean, and Extreme Programming (XP). Each embodies the core principles of frequent iteration, continuous learning, and high quality in its own way.~\cite{agile-methodology} \\
We are now going to explain the Scrum framework.

\subsection{Scrum}

Scrum is an agile project management framework, which is different from Agile, a philosophy.\\
The definition of scrum is based on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism says that knowledge comes from experience and that decisions are made based on what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on essentials. The scrum framework is heuristic; it is based on continuous learning and adjustment to fluctuating factors by acknowledging that the team does not know everything at the start of a project and will evolve through experience. Scrum is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements, with re-prioritization built into the process and short release cycles so your team can constantly learn and improve.~\cite{scrum}

  \caption{Scrum sprint cycle. Taken from \texttt{atlassian.com}}
  \label{fig:scrum-sprint-cycle}
\end{figure}

As visible in~\cref{fig:scrum-sprint-cycle}, Scrum is split in four principal phases: the sprint planning, the daily scrum, the sprint review and the sprint retro. \\
The sprint planning is the initial phase of a sprint, the actual time period when the scrum team works; the team meets and decides what to do in the sprint by placing the tasks from the product backlog to the sprint backlog. The product backlog is a list of all the tasks that need to be done in the project: they could be features, bug fixes, or improvements. Instead, the sprint backlog is a list of tasks that the team has committed to complete in the sprint. \\
The daily scrum is a daily meeting where the team members synchronize each other. It is usually taken stand-up, as a way to not waste time and to keep the meeting short.\\
The sprint review and retrospective are the meeting at the end of the sprint where the team shows what they have done and they demonstrates the work to the stakeholders and receives feedback.
